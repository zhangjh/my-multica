 * How an exact status-key filter resolves to board/list COLUMNS (MUL-6243).

 * loaded, which is indistinguishable from a real value. Routing on that guess
 * paged the unstarted column for a saved `qa` filter while the query still
 * restricted `status=qa`.
 *
 * Returning an empty column set for that case is equally wrong: the caller
 * cannot tell "narrow to nothing" from "cannot answer yet", so it fetched no
 * branches and rendered an empty board with no spinner and no error. Hence the
 * explicit state:
 *
 * - `resolved` — every key answered; `columns` is authoritative.
 * - `pending`  — a custom key needs a catalog that is still in flight. Hold the
 *                surface's loading state; do not fetch and do not render empty.
 * - `error`    — the catalog request failed. Show a retryable error; a custom
 *                filter cannot be honoured without it.
