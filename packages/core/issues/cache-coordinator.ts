/**
 * IssueCacheCoordinator — the one rules table for how a single issue change
 * propagates through the query cache.
 *
 * Every write path converges here: `useUpdateIssue` (onMutate optimistic +
 * onSuccess server reconcile), `useBatchUpdateIssues`, and the WS
 * `issue:updated` handler all call {@link applyIssueChange}, so "I changed
 * it" and "someone else changed it" follow the same rules by construction.
 *
 * The rules, per loaded bucketed list (workspace board + every myList
 * scope — My Issues, Project, actor panels, workspace members/agents tabs):
 *
 *   card present, filter untouched by the change → surgical patch (rebucket
 *     on status, position-slot insert; never a refetch — refetching the
 *     visible list is what made drags flicker)
 *   card present, no longer matches the list's filter → surgical REMOVE
 *     (bucket total decremented) — the "issue left this surface" case that a
 *     filter-blind patch used to leave behind (MUL-3669)
 *   card present, membership undecidable client-side (involves / my:all) →
 *     patch + mark the key stale
 *   card absent, change can't affect this list → skip
 *   card absent, stayed a member + status changed → move one unit of the
 *     server total between the two buckets immediately, then mark the key
 *     stale: the row's slot in the destination bucket's loaded window is
 *     server knowledge, and under staleTime: Infinity an explicit
 *     invalidation is the only channel that ever fills it in
 *   card absent, left the list (reassigned / re-projected) → old status
 *     bucket total -1
 *   card absent, may have ENTERED, or anything undecidable (no base entity,
 *     unknown membership) → mark the key stale (never hard-insert: the
 *     right page/slot under the list's sort+filter is server knowledge)
 *
 * Stale keys are NOT invalidated here — timing is the caller's contract:
 * mutations defer them to onSettled (invalidating mid-flight would refetch
 * uncommitted state and stomp the optimistic patch), the WS path invalidates
 * immediately (the server already committed).
 *
 * The detail cache and the Inbox issue projections are patched in the
 * same pass. Aggregate projections that cannot be recomputed from one entity
 * (assignee-grouped boards, Gantt, project metrics) go through
 * {@link invalidateIssueDerivatives}.
