/**
 * Catalog mutations (MUL-6243).
 *
 * No mutation invalidates the catalog on success. The refresh is the
 * `issue_status:changed` realtime event, which reaches the writing tab as well
 * as every other one, so a catalog edit costs each client exactly ONE catalog
 * read. Invalidating here too would make the admin who did the writing the
 * only client that reads it twice. (MUL-6458)
 *
 * That refetch is what CONVERGES the cache, and it is ordered correctly by
 * construction: the event is published after the write commits, so the refetch
 * it triggers can only read post-commit state.
 *
 * Which is why no mutation writes its RESPONSE BODY into the cache. A response
 * is authoritative for the row as of that write, not as of now — and the two
 * channels are independent, so a slow response can land after a refetch that
 * already picked up someone else's later write and quietly roll the catalog
 * back to a state nothing will correct. Every local write below is instead
 * something that stays true no matter what else has landed in between:
 *
 * - an optimistic field patch (rename, recolor, reorder),
 * - an insert of a row nobody else can have seen yet (create),
 * - a monotonic flag (archive — there is no unarchive endpoint, and the server
 *   refuses to edit an archived row, so setting it can never be stale).
 *
 * On FAILURE the invalidate stays, and it is not symmetry for its own sake: a
 * 409 usually means this client's catalog is the stale thing — someone else
 * took the name, or archived the row that was being dragged.
