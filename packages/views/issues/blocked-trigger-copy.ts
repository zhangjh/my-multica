// Localized copy for a blocked @agent / @squad trigger outcome (MUL-4525 §2),
// shared by the composer preview chip and the post-send toast so both name the
// same reason the same way. `reason_code` is the enumeration-safe wire code; the
// label it maps to never reveals the target's identity — the caller supplies the
// name it already has from the user's own mention markup.
//
// A label must not assert a cause the code does not carry. `invocation_not_allowed`
// is deliberately ambiguous server-side (see dispatch/reason.go): it covers BOTH
// "you may not invoke this target" and "this id resolved to nothing here". Copy
// that blamed permission alone sent people to audit agent visibility settings over
// what was really a mistyped mention uuid (MUL-5548), so both labels name the two
// possibilities instead.
//
// `agent_runtime_required` and `runtime_offline` are kept apart for the same
// reason (MUL-5559): an unbound agent has no machine to reconnect, so "runtime
// offline" copy sends the user looking for a computer that does not exist. The
// fix it needs is binding the agent to a runtime.
//
// `runtime_unusable` is the third member of that family (MUL-6164): the machine
// IS reachable and its agent CLI cannot be executed there, so "offline" copy
// sends the user to reconnect something that is already connected. The fix is a
// reinstall on that machine, and the system comment the server leaves on the
// issue carries the exact command.
//
// `runtime_access_denied` is another member of that family (PUCK-89): the
// target is permitted but its agent owner cannot execute it on the selected
// private runtime. No retry helps — the fix is making the runtime public or
// rebinding/copying the agent to a runtime its owner can use.
//
// `runtime_profile_missing` is split from `runtime_unusable`
// on the same rule: the CLI there runs perfectly and is missing a runtime
// profile (DSH's `multica` profile, which supplies the protocol Multica
// drives). "Reinstall the CLI" copy sends the user to re-run an install that
// was never broken; the fix is installing the profile.
