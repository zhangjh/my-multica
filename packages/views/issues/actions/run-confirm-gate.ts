 *
 * - **assign**: giving the issue an agent/squad owner. Skipped only when the
 *   issue is on the fixed backlog key, because assigning into that status
 *   never starts a run (`server/internal/service/issue_trigger.go`) and the
 *   dialog would promise something that cannot happen.
 * - **promote**: moving an already-owned issue out of the fixed backlog status.
 *   That status change alone starts the run (`RunSourceStatus`), so it earns
 *   the same dialog when the target is not terminal, including custom statuses.
 *
 * Unresolvable categories fail toward confirming: a dialog the user dismisses
 * costs a click, a silent start costs an unwanted agent run.
