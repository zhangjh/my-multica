-- name: ListCommentsForIssue :many
-- The NEWEST $3 comments for an issue, returned in chronological order.
--
-- Same shape and same reason as ListActivitiesForIssue: the inner query takes
-- the window with the keyset ordering so the cap discards the OLDEST rows, and
-- the outer query restores the ascending contract callers rely on. The ordering
-- of the inner window is satisfied by idx_comment_issue_keyset (migration 068);
-- the outer query sorts that bounded window back into chronological order.
--
-- A newest-N window is a suffix of the timeline, and unlike a prefix it is NOT
-- closed under "parent of": a reply is always newer than its parent, so an old
-- thread root can fall outside the window while a fresh reply to it stays
-- inside. Callers that render threads must close the parent chains afterwards —
-- see completeCommentThreads (MUL-5492).
--
-- The cap is still purely defensive here — issue p99 is ~30 comments and the max
-- ever observed in prod is ~1.1k — but "defensive" is not a reason to drop the
-- newest rows when it does fire (MUL-5492).

--
-- Why thread-grouped instead of row-recent: with row-recent the newest 20
-- comments can come from 8 different threads — the agent sees 8 unrelated
-- tails. With thread-grouped the agent sees N complete conversational arcs,
-- which matches how a human reads an issue (#2340).
--
-- Response ordering:
--   threads:     (thread_last_activity_at ASC, root_id ASC)

-- what makes their reply check exact.
