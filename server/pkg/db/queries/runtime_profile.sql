-- name: ListActiveAgentsByProfile :many
-- Active (non-archived) agents bound to any runtime instance of this profile.
-- The profile-delete path uses this to refuse deletion (409) while agents
-- still depend on it, mirroring the runtime-delete guard.
--
-- It returns the rows rather than a count because the refusal has to name
-- them: a profile spans every machine that registered it, so the agents
-- blocking the delete are routinely bound to a different machine than the one
-- the user was trying to clean up, and a bare count gives them no way to tell
-- (GH #8456). Carrying the runtime is what lets the message say which machine.
--
-- Deliberately not filtered by kind: it defines when deletion is refused, and
-- narrowing it to user agents here would let a profile with a bound builder
-- carrier through, whereupon TeardownRuntime would hard-delete that carrier.
--
-- system_key rides along because it, not kind, decides what the user can
-- actually do about a blocker. Mika is kind='user' with system_key='mika' and
-- can be neither archived nor moved; a builder carrier is kind='system' and is
-- released by its Builder session, not from the agent list.
--
-- Bounded on purpose. The caller only needs to know that blockers exist, name a
-- few, and report how many there are — it never needs every row. This runs
-- inside the delete transaction while profile, runtime and agent rows are
-- locked, and the response is buffered whole before it is written, so an
-- unbounded read here would make both the time under lock and the response body
-- grow with the number of agents a profile has accumulated across machines.
--
-- The per-class counts are what let the refusal stay correct while bounded.
-- Rows are ordered by machine and name, so which blockers land inside the LIMIT
-- is arbitrary with respect to class: twenty ordinary agents can push the one
-- Mika to position 21. A message whose advice came from the visible rows would
-- then tell the user to archive all of them — the unactionable instruction this
-- whole change removes, just deferred. So the recovery paths are chosen from
-- these counts and only the names come from the rows.
--
-- Every count is a window function over the pre-LIMIT result, so they stay
-- exact no matter how small max_rows is. blocker_class is emitted per row as
-- well, giving the classification one definition that the Go classifier is
-- pinned against in tests.
