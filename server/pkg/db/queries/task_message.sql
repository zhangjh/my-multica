-- name: CreateTaskMessages :many
-- Batch variant of CreateTaskMessage: persists a whole daemon-reported batch in
-- ONE statement — therefore one round trip and, more importantly, one commit
-- instead of one per message. Commit acknowledgement (IO:XactSync) is ~94% of
-- this SQL's load in production, so the commit count is the thing being
-- optimized; the round trip is a bonus.
--
-- The rows arrive as parallel arrays rather than as one jsonb document, even
-- though a jsonb document is the tidier Go side. content and output routinely
-- carry tens of KB and occasionally megabytes, and wrapping them in JSON makes
-- the server escape every byte a second time and Postgres parse the whole
-- envelope back out — measured at 1.2x the old per-row insert at 128KB and
-- ~1.8x at 1MB, i.e. a regression on exactly the most expensive requests, which
-- are also the ones least likely to be batched. Native text[] elements are
-- length-prefixed by the wire protocol, so they cost neither pass.
--
-- NULLIF is what makes per-row NULL expressible through a non-nullable []string
-- (the Go type sqlc gives a text[] parameter): it reproduces, exactly, the
-- `pgtype.Text{Valid: x != ""}` mapping the single-row query carries — empty
-- string means SQL NULL. input is passed as text and cast here for the same
-- reason; it is the one column that genuinely has to be parsed as JSON, because
-- it is a jsonb column. created_at also rides this transport so an older daemon
-- can omit its event time and keep the database-time fallback. output_truncated
-- uses the same trick because it is a genuinely tri-state boolean (NULL = the
-- reporting daemon did not measure it), and a bool[] parameter becomes a Go
-- []bool, which has no way to spell the third state.
--
-- Callers MUST still run the Postgres text sanitizer first. A NUL anywhere in
-- the batch fails the whole statement (GH #7098) — that is inherent to batching
-- into one statement, not to the parameter shape.
--
-- Atomicity is a deliberate side effect, not just a speedup: the per-message
-- loop this replaces could persist part of a batch and then fail, leaving the
-- transcript with a prefix of the batch and no way to complete it — the daemon
-- does not retry this endpoint. One statement makes the batch all-or-nothing,
-- which buys consistency; a batch that fails is still lost whole, so closing
-- the gap for real needs a retry plus a (task_id, seq) uniqueness rule.
--
-- The ORDER BY is a contract, not decoration. A bare `INSERT ... RETURNING`
-- has no defined row order, and the caller republishes these rows as realtime
-- events in the order they arrive — the per-row loop this replaces implicitly
-- published in request order, so the ordering has to be restored explicitly or
-- subscribers can see a batch out of order. seq is assigned by the daemon and
-- increases within a batch, so it is the request order.
