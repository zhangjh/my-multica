// Package taskfailure is the canonical, refined taxonomy of values written
// into agent_task_queue.failure_reason and chat_message.failure_reason.
//
// History: until MUL-1949, server/daemon code wrote one of a small handful
// of coarse failure_reason values ("agent_error", "timeout",
// "runtime_offline", …). The "agent_error" bucket grew to ~30% of all
// failures and hid the real cause (provider 401, quota exceeded, context
// overflow, runner crash, etc.) inside the free-form `error` text column.
// MUL-1949's offline backfill SQL re-classified those rows into 14
// agent_error.* sub-reasons via a CASE expression on the error text.
//
// This package lifts that classifier into the in-flight write path so the
// stored failure_reason is already refined when the row is first
// persisted, and so server / daemon / cloud share a single source of
// truth for the canonical values. PR1 of the Grafana board plan
// ([MUL-2946](https://multica/issues/MUL-2946)). Subsequent PRs use
// AllReasons() to pre-warm the Prometheus failure_reason label set.
//
// The canonical values fall into two groups:
//
//   - Platform-side values (no `agent_error.` prefix) emitted by the
//     server-side sweepers and daemon classifiers when the failure is
//     attributable to the platform/scheduler/runtime layer rather than
//     anything the agent process did:
//
//     queued_expired, runtime_offline, runtime_reconnect_timeout,
//     runtime_recovery, timeout, iteration_limit, agent_blocked,
//     api_invalid_request, skill_bundle_unavailable,
//     runtime_cli_timeout, environment_prepare_failed,
//     invalid_task_identity, runtime_access_denied
//
//   - 14 agent-side values (with `agent_error.` prefix) produced by
//     Classify(rawError) when the agent process surfaced an error string.
//     IsAgentError reports membership in this set.
//
// Wire stability: the string forms of these constants are persisted into
// the database and surfaced as Prometheus labels. Renaming a value is a
// breaking change. New classifier-derived values also require a matching SQL
// backfill rule; new platform-side events may be added directly because no
// historical rows need reclassification.

	// the workspace directory and its overlay homes, AND the per-provider
	// local config written or validated inside it (Codex home, Hermes
	// overlay, Cursor MCP, OpenClaw config, which fails closed on a config
	// the CLI cannot read). So the causes are wider than a disk fault: a full
	// volume, a read-only or permission-denied workspaces root, a directory
	// another process still holds open (Windows) and an I/O error all land
	// here, and so does a malformed local runtime config. What they share is
