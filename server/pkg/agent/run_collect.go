// One pass is not enough. A descendant whose fork completes between the kill's
// enumeration of the group and the signal's delivery never receives it, and only
// a later pass reaches it — measured 3 misses in 10 runs of the forking stub in
// run_collect_test.go, each leaving a `sleep 300` reparented to init. The window
// only has to cover that fork, so it is deliberately short: retrying for longer
// would widen the pid-reuse window documented on reapProcessTree, since the group
// id is the pid Wait has already reaped.

// collectSettleGrace bounds the one cleanup wait on the answer path: after the
// tree has been signalled, how long finish() waits for the reader goroutines to
// see EOF before handing the caller what arrived.
//
// Short on purpose, and by the time it runs the caller has already decided that
// reading is over — either the answer satisfied its completeness rule, or
// collectDrainGrace expired waiting for one. What this cap cuts short is a
// descendant that inherited the pipe and holds it open, whose trailing output is
// not the answer. EOF short-circuits the wait, so the normal case pays nothing.
// Package tests shorten it together with their process fixtures; production
// never reassigns it.
var collectSettleGrace = 400 * time.Millisecond

// collectDrainGrace bounds the wait for pipe EOF *after* the direct child has
// exited, before the tree is reaped.
//
// This exists because leader exit is not the end of output, and treating it as
// one is a data-loss bug rather than a slow path. A wrapper can exit
// successfully while the real CLI — its descendant, which inherited stdout — has
// not printed yet; npm and PowerShell shims make that the normal shape on
// Windows. Review measured the consequence on an earlier revision of this
// branch: the wrapper exits 0, its child prints the version 500ms later, and
// reaping on leader exit returned an empty answer with a nil error, where
// os/exec's own EOF wait returns the version.
//
// So EOF is the signal, and this is its bound. 2s matches probeWaitDelay, which
// is the equivalent bound os/exec applies for the same reason on the
// launch.go helpers — a descendant that never closes the pipe must not hold the
// call forever.
//
// A caller's completeness rule short-circuits it: once the answer is in the
// buffer there is nothing left to wait for, so the normal case — a CLI that
// prints its answer and exits, with or without a lingering helper — pays
// nothing.
// Package tests shorten it together with their delayed-output fixtures;
// production never reassigns it.
var collectDrainGrace = 2 * time.Second

// collectStdoutLimit caps the answer this package will accumulate, and
// collectStderrTail caps the diagnostic sample kept from stderr.
//
// Both streams were unbounded in an earlier revision, and review measured the
// cost: a CLI writing continuously for the probe window retained 13,107,400
// bytes of stderr where launch.go's outputOwned keeps the last
// probeStderrSampleBytes (32 KiB). A broken local CLI in a log loop could
// exhaust daemon memory before any deadline helped.
//
// The two limits are deliberately different in kind, because the streams are:
//
//   - stderr is a diagnostic sample, so the *tail* is what matters — a CLI's
//     actual failure line is at the end. Keeping the last 32 KiB matches
//     outputOwned exactly, so moving a call site between the two mechanisms
//     cannot change what a failed probe reports.
//   - stdout is the answer, and silently dropping part of an answer is how a
//     truncated catalog becomes a "successful" empty one. So it is capped and
//     the overflow is reported as an error instead: a one-shot response that
//     exceeds this is a malfunction, not a large answer. Where that cap falls is
//     derived from the largest answer these call sites ask for; see
//     collectStdoutLimit below.
const collectStderrTail = probeStderrSampleBytes

// A var, not a const, so a test can shrink it rather than generating megabytes to
// reach it — the same reason detectVersionTimeout is one. Production never
// reassigns it.
//
// 8 MiB is derived rather than picked, because where this falls is a product
// compatibility boundary and not only a memory bound: a legal config past the cap
// stops a task from starting. The derivation, in the order it constrains the
// value:
//
//   - What is actually asked for. Measured on OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2:
//     `config validate --json` answers in 715 bytes and `config file` in 2663.
//     The largest answer any call site asks for is the fully resolved config from
//     `config get --json`, whose size scales with the user's agents and MCP
//     servers.
//   - There is no upstream ceiling on either, so the worst case is constructed:
//     1000 agents and 250 MCP servers, with the fields OpenClaw's resolved config
//     carries, serialises to 547,291 bytes. Real deployments carry single-digit
//     agent counts, so that is already orders of magnitude past the field. This
//     bound leaves 15x on top of *it*, which is what
//     TestCollectStdoutLimitHasHeadroomOverTheLargestAnswer asserts — the
//     construction lives in the test so the derivation cannot drift from the
//     value silently.
//   - It matches what the daemon already holds for a comparable per-task payload
//     it reads whole into memory (internal/daemon's maxLocalSkillBundleSize is the
//     same 8 MiB), so the two limits do not have to be reasoned about separately.
//     Named rather than imported: pkg/agent is the lower layer.
//
// A cap of some size is unavoidable rather than a design choice: every caller
// parses the answer as one document, so an answer that cannot be held in memory
// cannot be used either. What the derivation buys is that the boundary sits far
// outside any answer a real host produces, and TestCollectedStdoutBoundaryIsExact
// pins exactly where it is — at the limit the answer is returned whole, one byte
// past it fails closed with errCollectStdoutTooLarge instead of being silently
// shortened.

// collector runs a command with pipes this package owns, rather than handing
// os/exec an io.Writer and letting it do the draining.
//
// That distinction is the whole point, and it is the one thing launch.go's
// runOwned / outputOwned / combinedOutputOwned cannot do. When os/exec owns the
// draining, Wait blocks until the output pipes reach EOF, and EOF requires every
// write end to be closed — so a CLI that forks a helper inheriting stdout
// (OpenClaw spawns `openclaw-config`) keeps Wait open for the helper's lifetime.
// Cancelling the context does not help: it kills the direct child without
// unblocking os/exec's io.Copy. Handing os/exec an *os.File instead means it
// starts no copy goroutine at all, so Wait returns the instant the direct child
// exits and this package decides when reading is over.
//
// The owned helpers bound that wait with probeWaitDelay instead, which is the
// right trade for the probes they serve — but the bound expires into
// exec.ErrWaitDelay, so a CLI whose answer arrived and whose helper lingered is
// reported as a failed call. On the OpenClaw paths that is not tolerable: a
// failed `--version` skips runtime registration, and a failed `config file`
// fails task preparation. See RunCollectQuiet for the guarantees this buys and
// the one it cannot make.
//
// The corollary, learned the hard way: because this package decides when reading
// is over, it must decide correctly. The direct child's exit is evidence about the
// direct child only — a wrapper that exits while its descendant still owes the
// answer is the normal shape on Windows — so awaitOutputAfterExit waits for pipe
// EOF, bounded, unless the caller's rule says the answer is already in.
