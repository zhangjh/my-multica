# Migration runner operations

## Prebuild the chat-session delete lookup index

Migration 472 builds `idx_agent_task_queue_chat_session`, which keeps the
legacy `chat_session` foreign-key delete action from scanning the global task
queue for every deleted chat. Its ordered keys also continue to cover
`AdvanceCancelledChatSessionPointer` after migration 473 removes the narrower
migration 465 index. The replacement includes every task attached to a chat,
so measure the eligible population before scheduling the build:

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS indexed_rows
FROM agent_task_queue
WHERE chat_session_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Migrations run during backend startup, whose Helm startup probe allows ten
minutes. On a large production table, check for long-running transactions and
prebuild the index in a low-traffic window. Run the statement by itself and
outside a transaction:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_agent_task_queue_chat_session
ON agent_task_queue (chat_session_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE chat_session_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Confirm the build is usable before deploying:

```sql
SELECT indexrelid::regclass AS index_name,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS size,
       indisvalid,
       indisready,
       indislive
FROM pg_index
WHERE indexrelid = to_regclass('idx_agent_task_queue_chat_session');
```

Migration 472 then becomes a fast no-op. Migration 473 only drops the narrower
index concurrently and does not scan `agent_task_queue`; migration 474 builds a
single-column index on `dingtalk_bot_identity`, not the global task table. If an
interrupted manual build leaves the replacement index invalid, drop that invalid
index concurrently and retry the standalone build before deploying. The
migration runner also registers invalid-index cleanup so an interrupted startup
build can recover on its next attempt.

Application rollback is compatible with the extra index, so leave it in place.
A full database rollback restores migration 465's narrower index before dropping
the replacement, but returns chat-session deletes to the global task-table scan.

## Issue description search index retirement

Migrations 463 and 464 retire the two historical issue-description search
indexes: `idx_issue_description_bigm` and `idx_issue_description_trgm`.
`SearchIssues` now scans the selected workspace's issue candidates and evaluates
description matches during projection, so neither global description GIN is
read. Fresh installs also skip migration 139's historical trigram build. Do not
repair or recreate these indexes after applying migrations 463 and 464.

The down migrations restore the trigram index everywhere and also restore the
CJK-friendly bigram index where `gin_bigm_ops` is available. Both use
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and retry safely after an interrupted build.

These migrations run during backend startup. A concurrent drop can wait for old
transactions, so for multi-gigabyte production indexes prefer a low-traffic
window: check for long-running transactions, then run each statement separately
and outside a transaction before deploying:

```sql
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_issue_description_bigm;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_issue_description_trgm;
```

The subsequent migrations become fast no-ops. If startup performs a drop and
is interrupted, `IF EXISTS` makes the next run retry safely; one index may
remain until that retry completes. Rolling back to the current candidate-first
search remains functionally correct without either index, but rolling back to
the legacy search can make description queries much slower or time out until
the database rollback rebuilds the indexes. Rebuilding up to two multi-gigabyte
GIN indexes is not immediate; verify every restored index is live, ready, and
valid before relying on it:

```sql
SELECT indexrelid::regclass AS index_name, indisvalid, indisready, indislive
FROM pg_index
WHERE indexrelid IN (
    to_regclass('idx_issue_description_bigm'),
    to_regclass('idx_issue_description_trgm')
);
```

## Comment content search index retirement

Migrations 454 and 455 retire both historical comment-content search indexes:
`idx_comment_content_bigm` on pg_bigm deployments and the portable
`idx_comment_content_trgm` fallback. `SearchIssues` now scans comments through
`idx_comment_workspace` and evaluates content matches during aggregation, so it
no longer reads either global content GIN. Fresh installs also skip migration
140's historical fallback build. Do not repair or recreate these indexes after
applying migrations 454 and 455.

The down migrations restore exactly one historical index with
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`: migration 454 restores the pg_bigm index where
`gin_bigm_ops` is available, while migration 455 restores the pg_trgm fallback
everywhere else.
Both restore the original `LOWER(content)` expression and retry safely after an
interrupted concurrent build.

These migrations run during backend startup. A concurrent drop waits for old
transactions, and the Helm startup probe allows ten minutes before restarting
the pod. For the multi-gigabyte production index, prefer a low-traffic window:
check for long-running transactions, then run each statement separately and
outside a transaction before deploying:

```sql
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_comment_content_bigm;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_comment_content_trgm;
```

The subsequent migrations become fast no-ops. If startup performs the drop and
is interrupted instead, `IF EXISTS` makes the next run retry safely; one index
may remain until that retry completes. Dropping the large relation can also
produce a short I/O spike as storage is reclaimed.

An application rollback remains functionally correct without either index, but
legacy search can be much slower. Database rollback must rebuild the selected
GIN and is not immediate; verify the restored index is live, ready, and valid
before relying on the old query's performance:

```sql
SELECT indexrelid::regclass AS index_name, indisvalid, indisready, indislive
FROM pg_index
WHERE indexrelid IN (
    to_regclass('idx_comment_content_bigm'),
    to_regclass('idx_comment_content_trgm')
);
```

## Build the issue properties bigram index after installing pg_bigm

Migration 446 builds `idx_issue_properties_bigm`, the index behind the prefilter
that scalar `contains` property filtering puts in front of its per-key ILIKE.
The runner only executes it where the `gin_bigm_ops` operator class is
installed; everywhere else the version is recorded with its SQL skipped, and the
filter keeps working without index acceleration.

That record is permanent, so a database that gains `pg_bigm` later never builds
the index on its own. Check first:

```sql
SELECT indexrelid::regclass AS index_name, indisvalid, indisready, indislive
FROM pg_index
WHERE indexrelid = to_regclass('idx_issue_properties_bigm');
```

If the index is missing, create it out of band. Run each statement separately
and outside a transaction so the concurrent build is valid:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_bigm;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_issue_properties_bigm;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_issue_properties_bigm
    ON issue USING gin (LOWER(properties::text) gin_bigm_ops);
ANALYZE issue;
```

The `ANALYZE` is not optional and not a formality. Building an expression index
does not collect statistics for its expression, and until they exist the
planner has nothing to judge the index by: it falls back to a pattern-length
heuristic that estimates a single-character needle at 5% of the table and
leaves `contains` on a sequential scan, with the index built, valid and unused.
Migration 447 does this after 446; an out-of-band build has to do it itself.

Keep the expression exactly as written: the predicate is
`LOWER(properties::text) LIKE LOWER(...)`, and an `ILIKE`-shaped or
non-lowered index would never be used (pg_bigm 1.2 on RDS has no ILIKE index
scan — the constraint migration 036 hit).

Confirm the statistics landed:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_statistic WHERE starelid = 'idx_issue_properties_bigm'::regclass;
```
