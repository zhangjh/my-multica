package main

// shutdown.go — the order teardown runs in, as named steps rather than as the
// order statements happen to appear in main().
//
// It is a type because one of the orderings is load-bearing and invisible at
// the call site. The WeCom cross-replica dispatcher delivers over the
// WebSockets the channel supervisor owns, and every supervised connection
// clears its sender from the registry as it exits. The supervisor starts
// exiting the moment its context is cancelled — not when it is joined — so
// "stop the relay before joining the supervisor" is not enough: by then the
// registry is already empty and the dispatcher's drain finds no socket for any
// installation and discards everything it exists to save.
//
// So the relay stop has to come before the cancel, and a comment saying so is
// exactly the kind of claim that quietly stops being true. TestShutdownSequence
// pins it against this type.

// shutdownSequence is every teardown step, in the order it must run. A nil step
// is skipped, which is what lets a deployment without a metrics server or
// without channels use the same sequence.

	// DrainHTTP before anything that serves it. In-flight handlers finish
	// calling Schedule() before the scheduler stops, and no new task
	// completion can arrive after this — which is what makes the relay stop
	// below a drain rather than a race.
	DrainHTTP func()

	// StopOutboundRelay BEFORE CancelWorkers. See the file header: the
	// dispatcher's drain can only deliver while the supervised sockets are
	// still live, and CancelWorkers is what starts tearing them down.
	StopOutboundRelay func()

	// CancelWorkers cancels the sweeper context every background loop is
	// bound to, including the channel supervisor.

	// StopHeartbeats flushes the final batch of queued heartbeat bumps.

	// DrainChannelRouter flushes debounced run triggers and joins in-flight
	// outbound replies, now that no supervisor is delivering inbound events.
