// dispatcher delivers over sockets the channel supervisor owns, each supervised
// connection clears its sender as it exits, and the supervisor starts exiting
// the moment its context is cancelled — not when it is joined.
//
// So "relay before supervisor" has to mean "relay before the CANCEL", and this
// pins it against the same type main() runs.
