// Built-in skills are the platform's standard "template" skills. These evals
// pin the template every skill must follow and — crucially — couple each
// skill's documented contract to the real backend behavior it describes, so a
// drift in the source-of-truth (e.g. the mention regex) breaks CI instead of
// silently turning the skill into a lie agents act on.
//
// The evals live in a _test.go file on purpose: anything *inside* a skill
// directory is walked into AgentSkillData.Files and shipped to agent machines
// (see loadBuiltinSkill). Tests must stay out of that payload.
//
// The same reasoning is what TestBuiltinSkillPayloadCarriesNoSourceReferences
// enforces for the payload's CONTENT (MUL-6986). A shipped skill is read on a
// machine that has no copy of this repository, so a file:line citation, a Go
// identifier, or a `go test` command in it is not merely useless — it sends the
// reader grepping for paths that do not exist. Evidence about how the server
// implements a contract belongs here, next to the assertion that pins it.
