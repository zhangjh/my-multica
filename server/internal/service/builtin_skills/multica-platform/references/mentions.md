# Mentions and delegation

What a mention link DOES. WHETHER to mention at all — loop avoidance, staying
silent on acknowledgements — is in your runtime brief's Mentions section; follow

## A mention link is built from a real UUID

The backend recognizes a mention only through this Markdown shape:

    [@Label](mention://<type>/<id>)

The parser accepts exactly four `<type>` values plus the `all` sentinel, and the
`<id>` group accepts only hex characters and dashes, OR the literal string
`all`:

    (member|agent|squad|issue|all)/([0-9a-fA-F-]+|all)

So the link target is a real entity UUID (or `all`), never a display name. The
label between the brackets is free text — that is where the human-readable name
goes.

One `mention://` form deliberately sits OUTSIDE this parser:
`[Label](mention://project/<uuid>)`. `project` is absent from the type group
above, so the backend never parses it and it can enqueue nothing — it is a
render-only link every client makes navigable (a chip on web and desktop, an
ordinary link that opens the project on tap on mobile). That is the whole point:
a project reference should never be able to start a run. Use it freely to point
at a project; everything else in this document is about the four types (plus
`all`) the parser does recognize.

## Step 1 — look up the UUID

A name is not a UUID. Look the UUID up first, from the matching list command:

- a person → `multica workspace member list --output json` → use `user_id`
- an agent → `multica agent list --output json` → use `id`
- a squad  → `multica squad list --output json` → use `id`

For a person the mention id is the `user_id`, NOT the membership-row id — the
backend's own roster formatter uses `user_id` for member mentions. Match by
display name. If the name is ambiguous or absent, do not guess — say so in your
comment instead of emitting a broken link.

## Step 2 — the four types and what each enqueues

Format: `[@Name](mention://<type>/<uuid>)`. The `<type>` and the id source must
match, or the link resolves to the wrong entity (or to nothing).

| To…                  | type     | uuid from       | What the backend does                                    |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| trigger an agent     | `agent`  | agent.id        | enqueues a run for that agent                            |
| hand work to a squad | `squad`  | squad.id        | resolves the squad's `leader_id` and enqueues a run for the LEADER agent |
| link a person        | `member` | member.user_id  | renders a link; enqueues NOTHING — no agent run          |
| reference an issue   | `issue`  | issue.id        | renders a link; enqueues NOTHING — always safe           |

The backend computes the trigger set from two types only: the `squad` branch
resolves the squad and adds its leader to the set; everything that is not
`agent` after that is skipped, then the `agent` branch adds that agent. A
`member` or `issue` mention reaches neither branch, so it enqueues no task.

A `member` mention therefore does NOT make a person "run", and no notification
is delivered through the comment path. What IS guaranteed is the contract above:
only `agent` and `squad` mentions enqueue work.

## Preview and per-comment suppression

Newer clients can call `POST /api/issues/{id}/comments/trigger-preview` before
creating or editing a comment. The preview endpoint runs the same trigger
computation as create and edit re-triggering, so the displayed agent chips come
from backend rules, not from a client-side reimplementation.

When previewing an edit, clients may send `editing_comment_id`. The server
validates that the comment belongs to the same workspace and issue, derives or
checks the edit's parent comment context, and excludes only pending tasks whose
`trigger_comment_id` is that same comment. Pending tasks from any other comment
on the issue still dedupe the preview.

When creating or editing a comment, clients may send an optional
`suppress_agent_ids` array. The server still computes the full trigger set
first, then removes those agent IDs as a post-filter. A missing or empty field
preserves the old behavior. A valid UUID that is not in the computed trigger set
is a no-op; a malformed UUID is rejected at the request boundary.

## @all is the broadcast type

`@all` uses the literal `all`, never a UUID:

    [@all](mention://all/all)

It addresses everyone on the issue. It does NOT make any specific agent run.
And it is special at trigger time: a comment that carries an `@all` mention is
treated as a broadcast that SUPPRESSES the issue assignee's automatic
on-comment trigger (and the other implicit routing fallbacks — thread parent /
conversation owner). Use `@all` to announce, not to request work from the
assignee.

`@all` only suppresses those IMPLICIT routes. An EXPLICIT `@agent` / `@squad`
mention in the same comment still fires normally: a comment reading
`[@all](mention://all/all) heads up — [@Preflight](mention://agent/<uuid>)
please take this` enqueues Preflight and nobody else. The explicit-mention
branch is evaluated BEFORE the `@all` short-circuit, so explicit mentions win
over the broadcast.

## What does NOT happen

None of these start a fresh run, and none produce an error response — but they
are three different things, and the response tells you which. A mention that
never parsed is a truly silent no-op. One that parsed and was refused comes back
in `trigger_outcomes` as `status: "blocked"` with a `reason_code`. One whose
target has a queued task in the same comment thread can come back `coalesced`.
A claim race can return `deferred`: the input is recorded for a follow-up run,
not injected into an already running prompt. Different threads queue independently. Read that array after posting — it is the only place any of this shows up.

- **A name where a UUID belongs.** `mention://member/Alice` is dead. The id
  group accepts only hex+dashes or `all`; the non-hex letters in a typical name
  make the whole pattern fail to match, so the parser returns nothing.
- **A hex-ish but wrong UUID.** A well-formed-looking UUID that no entity owns
  DOES parse, then no-ops at lookup: the workspace-scoped query finds no agent
  and the mention is reported blocked with `invocation_not_allowed`. That code
  is deliberately ambiguous — **a typo'd UUID and a genuine permission denial
  look identical on purpose**, because the id you typed could name a private
  agent in another workspace and the reason must not confirm that it exists.
  **So when you see `invocation_not_allowed`, check the UUID against the live
  roster BEFORE you touch any visibility or invocation setting**;
  `multica squad member list <squad-id> --output json` returns the `member_id`
  to build the mention from. An id that matches the pattern but is NOT a valid
  UUID at all (`mention://agent/-`) is rejected by the id parser and blocked
  with `target_unavailable` instead — a non-UUID names no entity anywhere, so
  it conceals nothing. Neither case is ever an error response.
- **An already-pending task.** Even a correct `@agent`/`@squad` starts no second
  run when the same target has a mergeable queued task in the **same thread**
  (the root comment and all descendants), with the same reviewed head. The
  outcome is `coalesced`; all covered instructions are delivered together.
  Different root threads and assignment-triggered runs have separate queue
  slots. Inputs received after execution starts belong to a successor run;
  `deferred` means a claim race durably recorded the follow-up obligation.
  Agent concurrency limits still apply, and runs for the same issue and agent
  execute serially. Stopping or retrying one thread does not cancel another
  thread's queue. Do not re-post a successfully queued/coalesced/deferred input. Edit preview is the only exception:
  `editing_comment_id` ignores pending tasks from the same comment being edited,
  because save cancels those old tasks before it re-computes triggers. It is
  still comment-scoped, not an agent-wide bypass.
- **A hand-off to the issue assignee because your target is busy.** A reply
  already routed to an agent stays with that agent; an offline or queued target
  is waited for, never swapped for the issue assignee. Mention whoever else you
  need by hand.
- **An archived agent, or one with no runtime bound** (likewise a squad whose
  leader is): blocked with `target_unavailable` and `runtime_offline`
  respectively. Both are checked only AFTER the invoke gate, so a caller who may
  not invoke the target never learns its state.
- **A private agent you cannot invoke:** blocked — the mention path applies the
  invoke gate to both `@agent` and `@squad`. That is the *run* gate, not the
  *see* gate: a workspace admin who can open a private agent in the UI still may
  not trigger it, so being able to view the target says nothing about being able
  to mention it. (The squad assignment/promote path has its own gate; the
  child-done wake is ungated.)

## Who the invoke gate judges

A chain that crosses issues keeps its human. The agent-to-agent gate judges the
human at the top of your chain, and that human travels on the comment you write:
the comment records the run that authored it, so the run it wakes inherits your
originator. This holds when you comment on a DIFFERENT issue than the one you are
running on — the ordinary "create issue Y, then coordinate there" flow — so a
delegation that works on your own issue keeps working on the issue you just
created. It does not go the other way: nothing ever substitutes a different human
(your agent's owner, or the target issue's originator), so if your chain has no
human at its top, member-scoped allow-lists stay closed no matter which issue you
move to.

One nuance for automation: when an UNATTRIBUTED autopilot run (a schedule/webhook
dispatch has no human originator, so the gate has no human to key on) delegates
by `@mention` while working on the issue that autopilot created, the invoke gate
falls back to the **autopilot creator** as the effective invoking user — the same
principal that admitted the first dispatch. So a mid-run `@agent` / `@squad`
delegation fires exactly when the autopilot creator could invoke that target
(owner / `public_to` match), and stays skipped otherwise. It is authorization
only — the enqueued run's originator/attribution is unchanged.

This fallback is bound to verified task lineage: it applies only when the
delegating run's own task is the one working on that autopilot issue (author ==
task agent, `task.issue_id` == this issue), so a run doing work elsewhere can
never borrow another autopilot creator's authority by commenting on its issue.
The same authority carries the plain assigned-squad-leader wake (a worker's
result comment on the autopilot issue can still wake the leader), and it survives
a busy target: if the mentioned agent is already running, the delegation is
replayed at that run's completion under the same authority, so it is never lost.

Editing or deleting input cancels active runs that contain that comment and
re-evaluates surviving inputs. These cancelled runs expose
`cancelled_by_comment_change: true` in task responses. Unstarted runs without
replies remain in execution history but do not create cancelled comment blocks;
manual cancellations and runs that already executed remain visible.

Deleting removes only that comment, never its replies. A deleted comment that
still has replies stays in `comment list` output as a placeholder — `deleted_at`
set, `content` empty, no attachments — so the replies keep their `parent_id`.
It carries no input: it never triggers a run, and there is nothing in it to
answer. It can still be the `--parent` of a reply that continues its thread.
Against a server that predates this, `comment delete` refuses instead of
deleting the replies too.

An edit is treated as a fresh action — it re-derives the comment's lineage from
the editing action. Only the agent author editing its OWN comment re-stamps the
lineage to the editing task; any other editor — including a workspace owner/admin
editing an agent's comment — CLEARS it. So editing an old autopilot comment from
an unrelated issue, or an admin editing an agent's comment (manage rights, not
invoke rights), fails closed at the deferred completion-reconcile instead of
reusing the original run's authority.

## Incorrect to correct

Incorrect: `@alice please review`
  → plain text, no link, parses to nothing, nobody is reached.

Incorrect: `[@Alice](mention://member/Alice) please review`
  → "Alice" is not a UUID; the id group rejects the non-hex letters, the
  pattern does not match, the link is silently dead.

Correct:
  1. `multica workspace member list --output json`  → Alice's `user_id` = 7f3a…
  2. `[@Alice](mention://member/7f3a…) please review`
     → a real `user_id` parses; the link renders and resolves to Alice.

@all broadcast: `[@all](mention://all/all) heads up` — addresses everyone,
runs no specific agent, and suppresses the assignee auto-trigger.

Using the wrong `type` for a real UUID still parses — it just resolves to the
wrong entity, or to nothing. That is why the type must match the id source.
