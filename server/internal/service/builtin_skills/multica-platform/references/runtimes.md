# Runtimes and repos

A runtime is the execution target behind an agent. A daemon owns local runtime
processes and claims queued tasks from the server.

## Core model

The chain is:

1. a user action creates or updates a queued task;
2. the task points at an agent and runtime;
3. the server wakes the runtime over the daemon websocket when possible;
4. the daemon polls and claims the task;
5. the server returns task context, repos, project resources, prior
   session/workdir hints, and a task token;
6. the daemon prepares a workdir and launches the provider CLI;
7. `multica repo checkout` talks to the local daemon, not directly to GitHub.

## CLI

```bash
multica runtime list --output json
multica runtime usage <runtime-id> --output json
multica runtime activity <runtime-id> --output json
multica runtime update <runtime-id> --target-version <version> --output json
multica runtime delete <runtime-id>
multica repo checkout <url>
multica repo checkout <url> --ref <branch-or-sha>
multica repo checkout <url> --fresh
```

Runtime and repo commands affect active agent execution. Do not restart daemons,
update runtimes, or check out arbitrary repos just to test.

`runtime usage` reports what the provider CLI reported. Claude and CodeBuddy
usage prefers the CLI's final per-model totals. If a run ends without usable
final usage, Multica can recover only main-loop input and cache tokens: split
assistant events with the same response ID count once. Output tokens stay zero
when no final count is available; that does not establish that the model
produced no output. Subagent totals require final per-model usage. Streams that
omit response IDs retain best-effort per-event input/cache accounting. These
fallback figures can be incomplete; use the provider's billing records for
actual charges. This correction applies to new runs, not historical usage rows.

`runtime update` and `runtime delete` are writes. Starting a runtime update is
limited to its owner or a workspace owner/admin; the original initiator may keep
polling that specific in-flight request if their admin role changes.

`runtime delete` removes a runtime registration; if active agents are still
bound, it refuses unless the user explicitly passes `--cascade`, which unbinds
those agents and cancels their queued/running tasks before deleting the runtime.
Unbinding keeps the agents and everything they own — instructions, skills,
chats, labels, channel installations, autopilots and task history — and only
clears the agent's runtime binding; an unbound agent cannot run until it is
bound again (`multica agent update <id> --runtime-id <runtime-id>`), and every
trigger path refuses it with `agent_runtime_required`.

`repo checkout` creates a dedicated branch in the task working directory. Most
runtimes use a linked worktree; Linux and Windows Codex use task-local Git
metadata so a task can stage and commit without making the shared repository
cache writable.

Running `repo checkout` again where the repository is already checked out
(the same task, a follow-up turn, or a reused workdir) never silently discards
work:

- a checkout with uncommitted changes, untracked files, or commits that no
  remote ref reaches is kept exactly as it is — no reset, clean, branch switch,
  or branch deletion — and only its remote refs are fetched;
- a checkout already on the current task's branch is treated as done, and only
  its remote refs are fetched;
- a clean checkout with nothing unpushed on some other branch still moves to a
  new branch from the latest default branch (or `--ref`).

When a checkout is kept, the command says so and reports its branch and how
many uncommitted files and unpushed commits it holds. `--fresh` discards the
existing checkout's uncommitted changes and untracked files and starts over on
a new branch from the latest default branch (or `--ref`). It deletes no branch
holding unpushed commits, so those commits stay on the old branch:

- with task-local Git metadata, the old branch stays in the checkout, including
  when `--fresh` replaces a linked worktree left by an older daemon;
- with a linked worktree, the old branch lives in the daemon's shared
  repository cache, whose periodic cleanup drops `agent/*` branches that no
  checkout has checked out.

Push any commits you still need before using `--fresh`. This needs a daemon
that includes the change; older daemons always start over.

`repo checkout` requires both `MULTICA_DAEMON_PORT` and the injected task-scoped
`MULTICA_TOKEN`; it is intended to run inside the active daemon task and from
that task's workdir (or a descendant). The local daemon authenticates the token
against its active-task registry, derives workspace/task/agent identity itself,
and rejects a caller-supplied workdir outside that task. If either variable is
absent, you are not in the normal agent checkout path. When a project
`github_repo` resource has `resource_ref.ref`, `repo checkout <url>` uses that
ref by default for the current task; an explicit
`repo checkout <url> --ref <branch-or-sha>` overrides it.

## Task CLI boundary

The daemon injects a task-scoped `mat_` credential for Multica API commands and
a private task-local Multica configuration root. Inside that managed task
context:

- API commands such as `issue list`, `issue get`, and `issue runs` use the
  injected task identity and never fall back to the daemon Owner's saved Multica
  profile.
- `config show` and `config set` operate only on task-local Multica state. A
  missing task config root fails closed.
- `auth status` may verify the task identity but omits all token material from
  its output.
- `daemon status` and `daemon disk-usage` report on the runtime hosting this
  task: `status` probes the daemon-injected health port, and `disk-usage` scans
  the daemon-injected workspaces root. Both refuse `--profile`, `disk-usage`
  also refuses `--all-profiles` and `--workspaces-root`, and its STATUS column
  stays blank because filling it would spend the Owner's credential.
- Human/local profile and daemon commands — including `login`, `logout`,
  `setup`, `workspace switch`, local runtime profile path mutation,
  `daemon start` / `stop` / `restart`, `daemon logs`, and
  `daemon probe-runtimes` — are unavailable. `daemon stop` in particular would
  terminate the daemon running this task and every sibling task on it.

`MULTICA_DAEMON_PORT` alone is a weak, defense-in-depth signal for task-safe API
and profile resolution, not task identity for human/local command rejection.
Genuine tasks also carry `MULTICA_AGENT_ID` / `MULTICA_TASK_ID`,
`MULTICA_TASK_CONFIG_ROOT`, or a daemon-managed workdir marker. When the port is
the only signal, `daemon status` uses the selected host profile's derived health
port; ordinary API and profile-resolving commands still fail closed. Host
operators should not export `MULTICA_DAEMON_PORT`; the daemon derives its host
health port from the selected profile and injects the variable into tasks
itself.

The daemon still preserves the real `HOME` and XDG variables for provider tools
such as `gh`, `aws`, `kubectl`, and npm. This is CLI resolution hardening, not
hard filesystem confidentiality: a process under the same OS user can still open
an explicitly known Owner path. Dedicated Unix users, containers, VMs, or an
equivalent OS boundary are required for that stronger isolation.

## Debugging an agent that did not run

Check in this order:

1. Was a task supposed to be created? Inspect issue/comment/autopilot context.
2. Is the assignee an agent or squad? A squad routes to its leader.
3. Is the agent archived or bound to a runtime the actor cannot use?
4. Is the runtime online? `multica runtime list --output json`.
5. Did the daemon heartbeat recently? Runtime `last_seen_at` is the visible clue.
6. Did the task get claimed or is it stuck pending/running/waiting for local directory?
7. If repo checkout failed, classify it after checking whether repo context was
   present in the task/project context.

## Repos

The runtime brief lists repos available to this task. Treat that list as the
authority for agent checkout unless the user explicitly asks to bind a new
project resource.

Workspace repos and project resources are not the same thing:

- workspace repo metadata can appear in workspace context;
- `github_repo` project resources are durable project context and can affect
  future tasks; optional `resource_ref.ref` pins the default checkout ref for
  tasks in that project;
- `local_directory` resources point at a path owned by a daemon and carry
  local-machine assumptions.

Do not add a project resource just because `repo checkout` failed. First
determine whether the user asked for durable project context or just a task
checkout.
