// The promise this file exists to keep: publishing an event NEVER waits for a
// third party.
//
// Bus.Publish calls listeners inline, on the goroutine of the request that
// published, so a listener that dialled an endpoint would put an outside server
// on the critical path of creating an issue. These tests hold the bus listener
// against an endpoint that never answers.

// synchronous this test hangs for the endpoint's full duration rather than
// returning in microseconds, which is the failure worth catching.
