package telegram

// delivery.go — reply-delivery ownership.
//
// A task's reply reaches Telegram through three paths: the streamed
// placeholder, the final answer, and the failure notice. In a multi-replica
// deployment they also run in three different processes — the daemon's
// transcript report and its completion callback are independent HTTP requests
// that land wherever the load balancer sends them, and the event bus is
// in-process. A process that cannot see the placeholder posts its own copy of
// the same answer, which is the duplicate users report (GH #8049, #7750).
//
// channel_reply_delivery is the shared owner, and this file is the only way to
// touch it. Three rules hold everywhere:
//
//   - One user turn, one owner. A path takes the turn's lease before it calls
//     Telegram and proves it still holds the lease when it records what
//     happened. "The UPDATE is atomic" is not the same as "only one process
//     delivers".
//   - A placeholder is not progress. Having an editable message says nothing
//     about how much of the final answer has been delivered; conflating the
//     two silently truncates replies.
//   - A send whose result was lost stays lost. Telegram's sendMessage takes no
//     caller-supplied idempotency key, so a retry cannot be deduplicated by
//     the provider. An unknown outcome ends delivery with the evidence kept.
