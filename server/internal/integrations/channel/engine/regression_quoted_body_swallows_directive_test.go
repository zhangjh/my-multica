// regression_quoted_body_swallows_directive_test.go — a bare /new or /clear
// sent as a reply to another message must still be only a directive.
//
// Router strips a directive from the agent-readable body along one of two
// routes: it re-parses Text itself, or it falls back to Text == CommandText.
// An adapter that renders quoted context ahead of the sender's words breaks
// both — the first line is now the quote, and Text no longer equals the
// command source — so a bare directive behind a quote survives into the body.
//
// The two failures are not symmetric, which is why both are pinned here:
//
//   - /new: neither route fires, "/new" is persisted as the first turn of the
//     session it just opened, and every later turn inherits it as context.
//   - /clear: the FreshSession branch rewrites Text to the (empty) command
//     body unless the adapter already stripped it, so the quote — the only
//     thing the person actually sent — is dropped without a word.
//
// The wecom adapter is the one that renders quotes today
// (wecom/ws_frame.go quotedContext); the messages below are the exact shape it
// emits, pinned from the other side in
// wecom/regression_quoted_directive_test.go. Router is what has to be driven,
// because neither failure is visible in the adapter's own output.
//
// Router already distinguishes context the sender chose from history it added
// itself (HasSelectedContext, message.go:149). A quote is the former, so the
// adapter sets it and these tests send it — the directive-behind-a-quote case
// needs no rule of its own on the Router side.
