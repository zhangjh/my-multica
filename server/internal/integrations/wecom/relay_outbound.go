package wecom

// relay_outbound.go — how a reply reaches the replica that can send it.
//
// WeCom is the one channel with no outbound REST path: every write goes over
// the aibot WebSocket, and the WS lease means exactly one replica holds it.
// chat:done, meanwhile, is published on the in-process events.Bus by whichever
// replica served the daemon's POST /tasks/{id}/complete — a load-balancer
// decision. Off-lease, outbound.go used to have nothing to do but drop the
// reply (GH #7215, #6890; SELF_HOSTING.md states the resulting constraint).
//
// This routes it over the Redis Stream relay the repository already runs for
// exactly this shape of problem: daemonws.RelayNotifier wakes a daemon
// connected to another replica by publishing under ScopeDaemonRuntime, and
// every node's XREAD loop hands the frame to whoever holds that connection.
//
// THREE THINGS THAT MECHANISM REQUIRES OF ITS CONSUMERS, and that a naive copy
// of the daemon-wakeup shape does not satisfy:
//
//  1. It replays. A shard reader starts from (now - ReplayGrace), not "$", so
//     events published while a pod was down are re-read — its own doc says
//     "downstream consumers must be idempotent". A per-process seen-set is not
//     idempotent across a restart, and does not span two replicas either. The
//     claim therefore lives in Redis, keyed on the turn, with a lifetime that
//     comfortably outlasts the replay window. Redis is not a new dependency
//     here: it IS the transport. No Redis means no relay, which means no
//     cross-replica delivery and nothing to deduplicate.
//
//  2. It calls the consumer SYNCHRONOUSLY on the shard read loop. The daemon
//     wakeup's work there is a map lookup and a buffered write; ours is a
//     network round trip that waits up to ackTimeout for the platform's
//     verdict. Doing that inline would let one unhealthy bot stall browser
//     realtime traffic, daemon wakeups, and every other bot on that shard. So
//     DeliverWecomOutbound only hands the frame to a bounded queue and
//     returns.
//
//  3. Its readers start early. Registration therefore has to be possible
//     before the senders registry and the subscriber exist: this object is
//     built and registered first, and Attach supplies the handler afterwards.
//     Frames that arrive in between wait in the queue rather than being
//     dropped against a nil field.
//
// ORDERING: every reply for one installation is carried by one queue and one
// worker, in the order it arrived — INCLUDING across a re-offer. A frame that
// has to be tried again does not go to the back of the queue; it parks at the
// head of its own installation's line and everything behind it waits, because
// two answers to the same person arriving in the wrong order is the defect
// this ordering exists to prevent.
//
// Sharding is a CONCURRENCY bound, not an isolation guarantee: installations
// are hashed onto RelayConfig.Shards queues, so two bots that collide on a
// shard do wait behind each other. What the shard count buys is that one slow
// bot cannot occupy every worker.
