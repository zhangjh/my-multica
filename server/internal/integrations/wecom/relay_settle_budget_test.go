// relay_settle_budget_test.go — the settle retry lives INSIDE the shutdown
// budget it was added under.
//
// The retry that resolves an unknown settle is worth having: a delivered reply
// whose claim never gets settled is a reply nothing counts. But it turned one
// store round trip into three, and a graceful shutdown promises to be done in
// DrainBudget. Both halves of that promise are checked here — the store call
// that must not take a fresh budget past its caller's deadline, and the loop
// that must not open a new attempt once the deadline has passed.
//
// Neither needs a database or a Redis: the rule under test is which context
// the work runs on.

// the whole drain with one, so a round trip that helped itself to a full fresh
// budget past that point spends time the shutdown already promised away.
//
// REVERSE VERIFICATION: restore context.WithTimeout(context.WithoutCancel(ctx),
// d.budget) and the first case fails with a deadline a whole budget out.
