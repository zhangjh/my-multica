package wecom

// outbound.go — the WeCom EventChatDone subscriber. After an agent finishes
// producing a chat reply on the bus, this subscriber looks up the wecom
// chat_session binding, resolves the live wsSender through the shared
// registry, and pushes the reply back as aibot_send_msg. Mirrors
// slack.Outbound; sessions with no wecom binding are ignored so it
// coexists with Slack / Lark subscribers on the shared bus.
//
// Kept lean: aibot has no threading, no per-bot outbound REST, and no
// mrkdwn conversion — the reply text goes through sendMsgTextBody the
// same way OutboundReplier's messages do (markdown msgtype, which
// renders plaintext without escaping).
//
// REPLICA TOPOLOGY: WeCom's only outbound path is the in-process WebSocket
// held in the sendersRegistry, but EventChatDone / EventInboxNew are
// dispatched on the in-process events.Bus, so the replica that publishes an
// event is not necessarily the one holding the bot's WS lease (Slack/Lark are
// immune — their outbound is stateless HTTP any replica can perform).
//
// With a sharded/dual realtime relay running, a reply or inbox push produced
// off-lease is forwarded to the lease holder over the relay
// (relay_outbound.go) and the single-replica constraint no longer applies to
// routing. Without a relay — legacy mode, or no REDIS_URL — the constraint
// stands: run the WeCom-enabled backend as a single replica. In every mode, a
// delivery produced while NO replica holds a live connection (all of them
// mid-reconnect) is still lost; that residual window is a durability problem
// the relay deliberately does not solve. Boot logs which of the two regimes is
// in effect. See router.go.
