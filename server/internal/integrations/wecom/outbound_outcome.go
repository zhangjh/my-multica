// outbound_outcome.go — what happened to a reply this adapter was asked to
// deliver, as something an operator can count.
//
// Every branch on the outbound path that ends a turn without putting words in
// front of the user used to be a bare `return nil` or a lone WARN. That is the
// shape of GH #7215 and #6890: the answer is in the Multica transcript, the
// WeCom chat stays quiet, and the server-side evidence is either one line with
// no reason attached or nothing at all. With several distinct causes producing
// one indistinguishable symptom, neither we nor a deployment's operator can say
// which one fired, and a fix is a guess.
//
// So each of those branches names itself. The counter is the durable half — it
// is always incremented — and the log level is the judgement half: a reason a
// person should act on logs at WARN, one that is ordinary in a healthy
// deployment logs at DEBUG and is only ever read as a rate.
//
// The reason set is closed on purpose. It is a metric label, and an open one is
// the unbounded-cardinality problem forbiddenMetricLabels exists to prevent.
