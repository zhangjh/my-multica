package wecom

// outbound_media.go — delivering the files an agent produced.
//
// The agent's side of this already exists and is platform-agnostic: it runs
// `multica attachment upload <path>`, the file lands in object storage, and
// CompleteTask binds the row to the assistant message it just wrote. What was
// missing was the last hop. Everything downstream of that bind assumed a chat
// window in a browser, so a WeCom conversation was told it could not take
// files at all.
//
// Three things decide the shape here.
//
// The answer goes first, always. An upload is megabytes and round trips and it
// can fail; the sentence the agent wrote cannot be made to wait behind one, and
// must not be lost to one. So this runs after the reply is out, on its own
// goroutine and its own budget, and its worst outcome is one extra line saying
// a file did not make it.
//
// The file is its own message. The long connection has no msg_item, so nothing
// can be embedded in a reply — "answer with an attachment" is necessarily two
// messages.
//
// And WeCom validates bytes against the msgtype. A .pptx declared as an image
// is refused rather than converted, and each kind has its own size ceiling, so
// what to call a file is a decision and not a lookup.
