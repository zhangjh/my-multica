// notifyParentOfChildDone posts a top-level system comment on the parent
// issue when a child issue transitions from non-done into done. This replaces
// the agent-prompt rule that previously made child agents post the
// notification themselves (PR #2918 user feedback — the agent rule caused
// self-mention loops, planner ping-pong, and accidental `MUL-` prefix
// hardcoding because the agent did not always know the workspace prefix).
//
// Guards on whether the comment fires at all:
//   - the child must transition from a non-terminal status INTO a terminal one
//     (done or cancelled). Repeat saves of an already-terminal child do not
//     re-fire; only the entering transition does. Cancelled counts because a
//     cancelled sibling never finishes and so closes its stage (see the entry
//     guard and isTerminalChildStatus).
//   - issue.ParentIssueID must be set
//   - parent must not be "done" or "cancelled" — the parent is already
//     closed and a notification has no follow-up to drive
//   - parent must not be "backlog" — a parent parked in backlog is being
//     deliberately held for later; waking its assignee (which can then
//     promote sibling backlog sub-issues into todo) is exactly the
//     unwanted auto-activation reported in #4320 / MUL-3497. A parked
//     parent stays inert until the user explicitly moves it out of backlog.
//   - parent assignee must not be a member (human). Humans read their
//     issues manually; an automated system comment is pure noise for them
//     and there is nothing to "trigger" on a human assignee. Skipping the
//     comment entirely (Bohan's call on MUL-2538) also sidesteps the
//     mention question — no comment, no mention, no inbox row.
//   - the completion must close a STAGE barrier (MUL-3508). Sub-issues under
//     a parent can be grouped into ordered stages via issue.stage; the
//     notification + wake fire only when every sibling in the lowest
//     unfinished stage is terminal (stageBarrierClosed). An unstaged sibling
//     set is one implicit stage, so this fires once when the last sub-issue
//     finishes instead of on every child — the default fix for the
//     fire-on-every-child cascade reported in #4320. The woken assignee
//     decides whether to promote the next stage (agent-driven advancement);
//     the server only detects the barrier and wakes.
//
// The comment is inserted directly via db.Queries (not through the
// CreateComment HTTP handler) so it bypasses the generic on_comment trigger
// path. When the parent has an agent or squad assignee, the comment body
// embeds a single `mention://{agent,squad}/<id>` link that targets the
// parent assignee — Bohan's product call on MUL-2538 ("system child-done
// comment 无脑 mention parent assignee，member/squad/agent 都覆盖", later
// narrowed to skip member assignees outright). To keep the platform in
// control of side effects, the cmd/server notification + subscriber
// listeners still skip system comments wholesale, so smuggled mentions from
// the child title cannot light up unrelated members. The parent assignee's
// own trigger is fired explicitly by dispatchParentAssigneeTrigger below,
// with the idempotency guard documented there.
//
// Errors are logged at warn level and swallowed: this is a best-effort
// notification on the side of a successful status update; failing it must
// not roll back the user's status change.

// listener is intentionally bypassed (it short-circuits on
// author_type='system'), so this is the single place where the platform
// applies the idempotency guard for the child-done notification.
//
// Side-effect semantics (intentionally narrower than a normal @mention):
//   - agent parent: one EnqueueTaskForMention on the parent assignee, same
//     trigger surface as a real @-mention so dedupe and readiness checks
//     match what users already rely on.
//   - squad parent: one EnqueueTaskForSquadLeader on the squad LEADER only.
//     Unlike a human @squad mention, this does NOT fan out to squad members
//     — child-done is a coordination signal, the leader decides whether
//     and how to wake the rest of the squad. Documented here so reviewers
//     don't read "system mention" as inheriting the full member fan-out. The
//     actor that closed the child is irrelevant to routing: the target is the
//     parent's own leader, chosen (and permission-checked) at squad-assign
//     time, so no actor identity is threaded in — see triggerChildDoneSquad.
//   - notification_preference is not consulted: this is a platform routing
//     signal targeted at the assignee that already owns the parent, not a
//     general notification. Per-user mute settings are evaluated by the
//     downstream agent_task / inbox pipeline once the task is dispatched.
//   - notification_listeners.go short-circuits on author_type='system', so
//     subscriber emails and member-inbox rows from smuggled mentions in the
//     child title are inert — only the explicit dispatch below runs.
//
// Guards applied here:
//   - No-op when the parent has no assignee row.
//   - NO self-trigger guard on either the agent OR the squad path. Waking the
//     parent assignee when one of its children finishes is a serial sub-task
//     handoff across two DIFFERENT issues, not a self-loop — legitimate per
//     isAgentRunningOnIssue and the @mention self-trigger path
//     (computeMentionedAgentCommentTriggers). The squad path used to skip a
//     same-squad or shared-leader child on the theory that the leader had
//     already observed the work through its own coordination cycle on the
//     child. That stranded the common pattern where a squad decomposes its
//     parent into sub-issues assigned to its own squad: the stage-barrier
//     system comment lands on the PARENT carrying the "advance the next stage /
//     wrap up" instruction, which a child-side wake never delivers — so the
//     parent silently stalled in in_progress (MUL-3969). The squad path now
//     mirrors the agent path (MUL-2808): always dispatch, bounded only by
//     idempotency.
//   - Idempotency: HasPendingTaskForIssueAndAgent dedupes rapid-fire enqueues
//     for the same parent (e.g. two children finishing back-to-back). It also
//     bounds any re-trigger, since a leader waking on the parent does not by
//     itself push a child back into a terminal transition.
//   - Readiness: archived agents / missing runtimes are silently skipped
//     so a closed-out agent does not surface as a phantom assignee.
