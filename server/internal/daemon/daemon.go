//     version. This is checked first so that once we've re-resolved to a new
//     binary, a reappearing stale path (a downgrade / reinstall recreating the

//     version — a mismatched {old path, new version} (MUL-4486 review).
//   - Otherwise, pinned Path still present -> returned unchanged, paired with
//     its registration-detected version. The anti-redirect guarantee holds for
//     the normal (never-healed) case: a live pinned binary is never
//     second-guessed even if PATH now points elsewhere.
//   - Pinned Path gone and no live heal -> re-resolve entry.Command once

//     runtime still actively executing tasks would have its work killed
//     just because the user added a sibling custom profile.
//
//  2. It tolerates ErrNoRuntimesToRegister (custom-only daemon disables its
//     only profile) by Deregistering the now-stale local runtime IDs and
//     clearing local tracking. Without this, registerRuntimesForWorkspace
//     would short-circuit on the empty list, the daemon would keep polling

// resolveTaskModelSelection settles the model selector and its capability
// overrides against the runtime's own model catalog, reading that catalog at
// most once per task — and not at all when nothing needs it.
//
// The single read is the point. Discovery is a CLI subprocess with a 15-30s
// ceiling, and cachedDiscovery deliberately does not memoize a result that
// came back empty or as a fallback (#3729, MUL-5549) so a transient failure
// can retry immediately. A logged-out or timing-out runtime therefore pays
// that ceiling in full on every read, and a task that read the catalog once to
// qualify its model and again to validate thinking_level would pay it twice
// before the agent even starts (MUL-6471 review).
//
// Who asks for the catalog:
//   - opencode and its DevEco fork cannot execute an unqualified selector, so
//     a pinned model has to be resolved against the catalog before launch.
//   - thinking_level / service_tier are catalog-owned and keyed on the
//     catalog's own model id, so they need it whenever they are set.
//
// A pi task with no capability override asks for neither: pi's own resolver
// accepts the persisted id in every shape it can take, so the daemon has
// nothing to add and skips discovery entirely. Same for claude, codex, and any
// task that pins no model.

// shouldRetryWithFreshSession reports whether a failed run that requested
// --resume should be retried once from a fresh session.
//
// Two independent questions have to both answer yes, and conflating them is
// how this went wrong before:
//
//  1. Would a fresh session even fix this? Only if the resume itself was
//     refused — permanently because the transcript is gone or belongs to
//     another provider account, or transiently because another live run owns
//     it. result.ResumeRejected and result.ResumeRejectedTransient are the
//     backend's positive evidence of those two cases. Both allow a fresh retry,
//     but only the permanent signal retires the prior session from later
//     lookups.
//     Answering by exclusion alone would invert the burden of proof: the
//     failures a new session cures are a small enumerable set, while the
//     ones it cannot are open-ended. A network drop, a 429, a quota trip or
//     a provider 5xx has nothing to do with the session, so resetting it
//     discards the one recoverable thing — the conversation pointer — and
//     re-runs the task for nothing. provider_network in particular is
//     documented resume-safe in internal/service/task.go (retryableReasons,
//     MUL-4910): the platform's own retry is supposed to inherit the session
//     and continue the truncated conversation.
//
//     Not every backend can answer, though, and a false ResumeRejected means
//     different things depending on who produced it: "checked, not a
//     rejection" from a capable backend, "could not tell" from one of the
//     backends in agent.ResumeRejectionUndetectable. That is why provider is a
//     parameter — without it the compatibility branch below would silently
//     apply to every backend, second-guessing capable ones by exclusion.
//
//  2. Is re-running safe? Only if the agent executed no tool. tools == 0 does
//     not prove the run mutated nothing — it proves we observed no tool use,
//     which is the strongest signal available here — but it is what stands
//     between a retry and a duplicated side effect. Comment creation has no
//     idempotency key and a duplicate re-fires its @mention triggers; the
//     retry also reuses the same workdir, which is never reset between
//     attempts, so a retry after real work re-plans on top of its own
//     half-finished commits.
func shouldRetryWithFreshSession(result agent.Result, priorSessionID string, tools int32, provider string) bool {
	if result.Status != "failed" || priorSessionID == "" || tools > 0 {
		return false
	}
	// Positive evidence: the backend proved the resume was refused.
	if result.ResumeRejected || result.ResumeRejectedTransient {
		return true
	}
	// Positive evidence of a different kind: the resume was NOT refused —
	// the transcript loaded fine — and the provider then refused to replay
	// it because a message in it is empty. ResumeRejected is false for every
	// backend here precisely because nothing rejected the resume, which is
	// why this needs its own branch rather than a phrase added to the
	// rejection list.
	//
	// It applies to all 18 backends, not the ResumeRejectionUndetectable
	// subset below, and that is deliberate: this is the one failure class
	// where dropping the session is provably the fix without the backend
	// having to detect anything. The evidence is in the provider's own error
	// text, which the common layer already has. Leaving it to each adapter
	// is how the same bug got fixed three times for Kiro, Kimi and Anthropic
	// while every other backend stayed broken.
	//
	// The tools == 0 gate above still applies unchanged — a run that already
	// used a tool is never re-run, poisoned history or not. Such a task still
	// gets its session retired, just by classifyPoisonedError at report time
	// rather than by an in-turn retry.
	if taskfailure.UnresumableHistory(result.Error) {
		return true
	}
	// Third form of positive evidence, and the same shape of argument: the
	// resume was not refused — the runtime happily rebuilt the session — but
	// the provider identity it rebuilt can no longer resolve its own
	// credentials, so the turn dies with "Could not resolve authentication
	// method" (GH #6777). The credentials are fine; only the session's copy of
	// the provider is broken, which is precisely what a fresh session
	// re-resolves from current config.
	//
	// This is the exception the Result.ResumeRejected doc calls out: adapters
	// must NOT flag auth errors, because a genuine credential failure keeps the
	// session so the platform's own retry can continue the conversation. The
	// distinction is resume-vs-fresh, not the error text — and priorSessionID
	// above already establishes that this run WAS a resume. On a cold run the
	// same error means the config really is wrong and this gate never sees it.
	//
	// Deciding here rather than in each ACP adapter is what makes it correct
	// for every step of the ACP lifecycle: the failure surfaces at
	// session/resume, at session/set_model (a resumed session whose persisted
	// provider was normalised gets a redundant set_model that re-routes to the
	// wrong provider — MUL-5029) or at session/prompt, and only two of those
	// three carry any resume-failure signal today. The final error text carries
	// the phrase on all three.
	//
	// Worst case, the config genuinely is broken: the fresh attempt fails the
	// same way, the user sees the same error once, and the single-retry budget
	// bounds the cost. That is the same trade the branch above already makes.
	if taskfailure.AuthMethodUnresolved(result.Error) {
		return true
	}
	// Everything below is a bounded compatibility path for the backends that
	// cannot answer question 1 at all. For every other backend a false

	// every backend before ResumeRejected existed; keeping it preserves their
	// recovery instead of silently removing it.
	//
	// Inventing rejection phrases for these backends would be the alternative,

// grafted onto the retry's result, or a later task would resume the bad
