// BuildNewCommentsHint returns the comment-reading pointer for a run that
// RESUMES its provider session and has new comments to catch up on. The server
// count is ISSUE-WIDE (every thread, not just the triggering one) and excludes
// the triggering comment itself because that body is already injected into the
// prompt. It ships only the COUNT and the cursor — never the comment bodies —
// so the server stays cheap and the agent pulls details on demand.
//
// The hint carries facts and this turn's exact commands: the issue-wide
// volume and ONE read that returns exactly the comments behind it. It states
// no modality: whether the scan runs is decided by step 2 alone, never here.
// The earlier wording ("don't read them all blindly … only if you need context
// from the other threads") made the same read optional that the brief calls
// mandatory, and measured across 537 comment-triggered runs the "only if
// needed" form meant "never": 0 of 36 non-scanning runs opened a thread the
// prompt had not already named, against 1 in 10 of the scanning runs
// (MUL-6984).
//
// That wide read used to be the roots scan plus a per-thread expansion — two
// or more calls to rediscover what the server already computed. A single
// `--since <anchor>` with no `--thread` IS the delta: ListCommentsSinceForIssue
// returns every comment on the issue created after the anchor, in every thread
// and at every nesting level, with no folding, and its predicate is the same
// `created_at > since` the server counted with (CountNewCommentsSince). It is
// therefore a strict superset of what the scan could surface: roots-only
// `last_activity_at` is MAX(created_at) over a thread, so any comment that
// could move a thread's activity is already in the `--since` result. Reading
// it satisfies step 2's scan, and the hint says so — the same rule as
// BuildResumedCommentsHint, where a server-computed EMPTY delta answers the
// scan (MUL-7344).
//
// The count and the read deliberately do not agree, and the text says so. The
// COUNT is what the agent needs to size the catch-up, so it excludes the
// injected trigger and the agent's own comments (CountNewCommentsSince). The
// READ has no such filter — `--since` returns everything after the anchor —
// and narrowing it to match would mean building a second, count-shaped query
// for no gain. An agent that sees more rows than the number was told why.
//
// Known bounds of the `--since` read, unchanged by this hint: the handler caps
// a page at 2000 comments and reports the cut in `X-Comments-Truncated`, which
// the CLI does not surface; and `--thread` combined with `--since` drops the
// thread root unless `--tail` is passed. The thread command below therefore
// stays on `--tail 30`, never `--thread ... --since ...`.
//
// Since MUL-5377 the per-turn prompt (daemon.buildCommentPrompt) is the only
// caller — the brief must not carry per-run routing state. The caller invokes
// this only when the session actually resumes; a run whose resume was dropped
// takes the cold path even though it carries a since-anchor.
//
// Renders nothing on cold start (no prior run → newCommentsSince empty) or when
// there are no new comments (newCommentCount <= 0) or issueID is empty. In those
// cases the caller falls back to BuildResumedCommentsHint (when a prior session
// is active) or BuildColdCommentsHint.

//
// The explicit "do not reuse --parent from previous turns" wording exists

// and will otherwise copy the old --parent UUID forward.
//
// The template is platform-agnostic AND provider-agnostic — the failure it
// guards against lives at the shell layer, so it cannot be scoped to one
// provider or one OS:
//
//   - Inline `--content "..."` lets the shell rewrite the body BEFORE the CLI
//     receives it: a backtick-wrapped token becomes a failed command
//     substitution that is silently deleted, the stored comment no longer
//     matches what the model intended, and a model that notices the mismatch
//     can retry forever (MUL-2904 / OKK-497). It also lets Codex emit literal
//     `\n` escapes inside `--content` (MUL-1467).
//   - `--content-stdin` with a HEREDOC has TWO failure modes the model cannot
//     see:
//     1. On Windows, PowerShell 5.1's `$OutputEncoding` defaults to
//     ASCIIEncoding when piping to native commands and drops non-ASCII as
//     `?` before the bytes reach `multica.exe` (#2198 Chinese, #2236
//     Chinese, #2376 Cyrillic).
//     2. On any host, when the model emits a multi-flag command (e.g.
//     `multica issue create --title ... --assignee-id ... --project ...`)
//     the bash heredoc/flag boundary is fragile: a `BODY \` "terminator
//     with trailing token" is not recognised as the heredoc end, so flag
//     lines after it are swallowed into the description; or a clean
//     terminator turns the trailing `--assignee ...` line into a separate
//     shell statement that fails while the create already succeeded with
//     no assignee. Both paths exit 0 with silently dropped flags. Github
//     issue #4182 documents two confirmed cases (OXY-78, OXY-76).
//
// The single safe path is therefore: write the body to a UTF-8 file with
// the file-write tool, post with `--content-file`, then remove the file.
// All flags live on one shell-token line; the body never touches the shell;
// no heredoc boundary exists for flags to leak across. This converges with
// the long-standing Windows path so the cross-platform template is one shape.
//
// provider is retained for caller symmetry and future per-provider tweaks; the
// guardrail itself is intentionally identical across providers and hosts.
