// This file holds the runtime brief assembler — the post-MUL-3560 path
// that `buildMetaSkillContent` delegates to. It used to be one of two
// paths gated by the `runtime_brief_slim` feature flag against a legacy
// verbose brief; the flag was retired in MUL-4297 and this is now the
// only brief.
//
// Layout:
//
//   - buildMetaSkillContentSlim is the entry point.
//   - It calls classifyTask (runtime_config_kind.go) to pick one of five
//     task kinds, then composes the brief from the per-section writers
//     below.
//   - Each section is its own writer so the matrix of "which kind gets
//     which section" lives at a single dispatch site.
//
// The brief applies two orthogonal optimisations:
//
//  1. Section gating per task kind — quick-create / chat / autopilot
//     skip sections they have no use for (Mentions, Comment Formatting,
//     Sub-issue, ...).
//  2. Per-section prose compression — Available Commands, Issue
//     Body Formatting, Mentions, Sub-issue Creation,
//     Comment Formatting, Always Use CLI, Background Task Safety, Task Initiator,
//     Repositories, Output are all tightened. Test-asserted phrases either
//     survive verbatim or are renegotiated to new semantic anchors in the
//     same PR (MUL-5442 established that discipline); no assertion is
//     dropped without a replacement.
//
// Background Task Safety is emitted by `writeBackgroundTaskSafetySlim`
// below.

// writeHeader emits the brief's leading title and one-line elevator pitch.

}

// writeBackgroundTaskSafetySlim emits the Background Task Safety section
// in its judgment form (MUL-5442): four paragraphs — the platform fact
// everything else derives from (turn exit is task-terminal, no wakeup
// exists, never background-and-yield), the external-systems/CI boundary
// with its single explicit-ask exception, and the persistent-service
// handoff contract. The pinned anchors the tests assert are the fact,
// each boundary, both exceptions, and the handoff triple.
//
// MUL-5223: the external-work boundary alone did not stop agents from
// blocking on CI. Two holes are closed here. First, the boundary was
// stated as a concept while the section's only concrete "how to wait"
// example was a blocking foreground call — and `gh pr checks --watch` is
// exactly that shape, so watching CI read as compliant. Named tool-shape
// bans replace the inference. Second, the "unless acceptance criteria
// require it" escape was being satisfied by the repo's own merge
// requirements ("CI must pass before merge"), so the section now says
// branch protection is not the agent's acceptance criterion, and gives
// the replacement hand-off phrasing so the urge to prove quality lands
// on local test output plus a PR link instead of on a wait.
//
// The ban is scoped, not absolute: an explicitly requested CI result is
// still reachable, and it names the one executable way to collect it
// (a single foreground blocking watch inside the same turn). Enabling
// auto-merge is not a wait and stays allowed — only waiting for it to
// land is banned.
//
// MUL-5274 adds one narrow lifetime exception: a user-requested local
// development/test service may be handed off after its readiness and cleanup
// contract are complete. It is not a future result or wakeup. The brief keeps
// this separate from tests, builds, monitors, and CI polling, which remain
// run-owned until their result is collected. The brief states only the
// handoff contract (lifecycle independence, durable logs, cleanup handle);
// how to detach is the Local Dev Environment skill's concern, not the brief's.
//
// Paragraph order: the CI exception lives INSIDE the boundary paragraph
// (one "The one exception" occurrence, count-guarded in the tests), and the
// persistent-service paragraph closes the section. A former scoping sentence
// ("The rules above apply only to work owned by the current run") stays
// dropped: the boundary paragraph carries its own scope ("are not
// run-owned").
//
// MUL-5442 stage 2 (owner-authorized judgment rewrite): enforcement details
// a frontier model derives from the platform fact were deliberately dropped
// — the run-owned work enumeration, the tool-promise enumeration, the
// wait/collect split rule, the persistent-service scope bullet, the
// auto-merge and snapshot elaborations. Their pins were retired in the same
// change. The incident history above (MUL-5223, MUL-5274, MUL-4091) remains
// the WHY for what stays: the named --watch/watch/poll ban and merge-gate
// denial survive because MUL-5223 proved the principle alone did not stop
// CI-watching, and the handoff paragraph is review-locked verbatim
// (URL/logs/stop triple, general cleanup handle) — do not reword it without
// a fresh review decision.

//
//   - Issue: the conversation IS the issue body and its comments. Untouched,

//   - Slack: the conversation lives in the channel and `multica chat history` /
//     `multica chat thread` can fetch it — see buildChatPrompt, which hands the
//     agent exactly those commands. Recoverable, just from a different place.
//   - Web chat, Feishu, WeCom and DingTalk: the conversation is persisted in
//     Multica's chat_message table and `multica chat history` reads it back —
//     see handler/chat_history.go's chat_message fallback for non-Slack

// the readable ones the discussion survives, so announcing "the previous
// context was lost" describes a loss that did not happen — the user reasonably
// hears "the discussion is gone" when not a word of it is. There the notice
// informs the agent and leaves mentioning it to the agent's judgement. What is
// actually gone on every surface is the agent's own unrecorded working memory,
// and each variant says so.

// that the run is on a fresh one, and that the memory gone is "from the turns
// that did not come back" rather than from every earlier turn. Under MUL-5305
// the server may hand back an OLDER session with the gap flagged, and the
// daemon resumes it (ResumeSessionID is not gated on the flag), so the agent
// can hold earlier turns' memory while the latest turn's is gone. Both phrasings

// There is deliberately no "turn mode" anymore (MUL-6417). The Reply/Ownership

// (one section, mode router) and MUL-6300 (reply turns own the same status
// arc); what remained was a marker plus two small blocks restating information
// the per-turn message already carries as data. The two rules that replace the
// router:
//
//   - Delivery routes on data: the per-turn message either carries a
//     triggering comment with this turn's --parent value (reply in that
//     thread) or it does not (post a new top-level comment).
//   - Status is written when the FACT changes, judged from what the work
//     changes about the issue — not from the trigger type, not from the run
//     lifecycle, and not gated on being the assignee. Lifecycle writes
//     oscillate under concurrent runs (every run flips its own open/close
//     pair — the churn MUL-6300's assignee gate existed to stop); fact
//     writes converge, because agents judging the same fact write the same
//     value or nothing. A todo issue the agent was only asked to research
//     correctly stays todo, which the old unconditional arc got wrong twice.
//
// The in_progress moment is the START of work, not the end of the turn: a
// turn that advances the issue's own ask makes "being worked" true the moment
// it begins, and the first work turn on a fresh assignment can run for half
// an hour — judged only at turn end, the board showed todo the whole time
// (Bohan's post-merge report on MUL-6417). This is the old rule's timing
// with the fact anchor's conditionality: an ancillary turn still writes
// nothing at either moment, so the concurrency convergence is unchanged.
// The activity indicator still shows the run itself, but columns, filters,
// and sorting read status — the indicator alone proved not to be the board
// surface people actually watch.
//
// The start write lives INSIDE step 3, not in the status block below —
// placement is load-bearing, not style. The first attempt stated it as a
// bullet under the status heading, and a run on MUL-6460 that verifiably had
// that brief walked steps 1→2→3 and never wrote a status: at the moment the
// condition triggers the model is executing the numbered list, and a rule
// outside the list does not fire (the pre-MUL-6417 opening write was
// reliable precisely because it was an explicit step). Same incident killed
// the "asked to research stays todo" example from the no-write bullet: that
// run's work WAS research toward its own issue's ask, so the example
// pattern-matched the exact case it was never meant to cover. Ancillary is
// now defined by output alone — the turn produced none of the issue's own
// deliverable. No activity-word list survives in EITHER direction: Elon's
// review on #7295 caught "review" still sitting in a skip-list (the same
// incident queued to replay on a review-the-PR issue), and J's review
// caught the positive form-list that replaced it ("code, research, a
// design, ...") — a whitelist reads as exhaustive, so a triage or
// reproduce-the-bug turn would not find itself in it. What remains is the
// criterion plus one never-decides sentence, placed inside step 3 because
// that is the position that fires. The exit-side check is anchored inside
// step 5 for the same reason, and the step-3 skip is scoped to the
// in_progress CATEGORY so a custom status like Planning already counts as
// recorded once MUL-6460 puts the catalog in front of agents.
//
// The invariants MUL-6300 pinned survive as consequences instead of gates: a
// conversational turn changes nothing about the issue's state, so it writes
// nothing; an @mention pull-in on someone else's (or an unassigned) issue
// almost never changes its state, so it writes nothing — but a turn that
// genuinely does move the work may now record it, whoever the assignee is.
//
// Step 2 is the ONLY place that decides WHETHER the scan runs (MUL-6984). The
// per-turn hints (execenv.BuildColdCommentsHint / BuildNewCommentsHint /
// BuildResumedCommentsHint) carry this turn's facts and exact commands and no
// modality. Before this, the brief said "always run the scan, even when the
// trigger looks self-contained" while the per-turn hints said "Need cross-thread
// background?" / "Only if you need context from the other threads" — two
// surfaces in one context, opposite modality, each written against a different
// incident (#3494/#3535 against blind bulk reads, #6093 against missed
// threads). The scan stays mandatory because the judgment "do other threads
// matter?" needs exactly the data the scan produces: measured on 537
// comment-triggered runs, 1 in 10 scans opened a thread the prompt had not
// named, and 0 of 36 non-scanning runs did. The one data-driven exemption is
// the server-computed empty delta on a resumed run, which the resumed hint
// reports as the scan's answer.
//
// Step 2 asks for a roots scan first, not `--recent 10` (MUL-5372). `--recent N`
// caps THREADS, not comments: each returned thread carries its root plus every
// descendant with no depth cap, so on an issue with fewer than N root threads it
// returns the entire comment history. Because this step is mandatory and fires on
// every run, making it the bulk read meant every reply turn re-read the whole
// issue — and, on comment-triggered turns, duplicated the bounded thread read the
// per-turn message had already pointed at (see daemon.buildCommentPrompt and
// BuildColdCommentsHint). `--roots-only --summary` keeps the anti-stale property
// that step exists for — the agent still sees every thread that exists — at a
// fraction of the payload, and the drill-down stays explicit.
//
// The step names ONLY the two reads it mandates. Flag semantics — including the
// `--recent N` saturation trap above — belong to `## Available Commands`, which
// is the single discovery point for the comment-read surface; repeating them per
// step is what made this one bloat in the first place.
//
// Squad leaders keep one status bullet: a dispatch turn leaves the parent
// mid-flight, so its end-of-turn fact is in_progress, and in_review waits for
// the re-trigger (member update / stage barrier) that confirms the overall
// goal is met. Flipping the parent on the dispatch turn would mark unfinished
// multi-stage work as ready for review; see the Squad Operating Protocol and
// child-done system comments.
//
// ctx.IsSquadLeader is a PER-TASK role, not agent configuration: branching on
// it here does move brief bytes when the same agent runs leader one turn and
// worker the next. Owner-accepted tradeoff; decision recorded in MUL-5811.
