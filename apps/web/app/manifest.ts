/**
 * Web app manifest — what makes the mobile web app installable and lets it run
 * in its own window instead of a browser tab.
 *
 * `start_url` is deliberately NOT "/". The official marketing hosts keep the
 * root path on the public site even for a signed-in session (see
 * `isOfficialMarketingHost` in middleware.ts), so an installed app pointed at "/"
 * would open the landing page. "/inbox" is one of `LEGACY_ROUTE_SEGMENTS`,
 * which middleware.ts resolves per session: signed in with a known workspace it
 * lands on that workspace's inbox, signed in without one it lands on /login
 * (which resolves against the workspace list), and signed out it lands on
 * /login too. All three are pinned in manifest.test.ts, because a launcher
 * icon has no URL bar to recover from a wrong destination.
 *
 * The icons under /icons are generated, not hand-drawn. To regenerate after a
 * brand change, edit public/icons/icon.svg and run from public/icons:
 *
 *   sips -s format png --resampleHeightWidth 512 512 icon.svg --out icon-maskable-512.png
 *   sips -s format png --resampleHeightWidth 180 180 icon.svg --out apple-touch-icon.png
 *   sips -s format png --resampleHeightWidth 512 512 ../../../desktop/build/icon.png --out icon-512.png
 *   sips -s format png --resampleHeightWidth 192 192 ../../../desktop/build/icon.png --out icon-192.png
 *
 * The two `any` icons come from the desktop app icon so an installed web app
 * and an installed desktop app show the same artwork; the maskable one is
 * full-bleed because Android crops it to the launcher's shape.
