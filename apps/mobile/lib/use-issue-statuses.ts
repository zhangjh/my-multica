/**
 * The workspace status catalog, resolved and memoized (MUL-6243).
 *
 * Mobile-owned mirror of `packages/core/issue-statuses/hooks.ts`. Two
 * deliberate differences:
 *
 * 1. **No `wsId` parameter.** Every mobile request is scoped by the
 *    `X-Workspace-Slug` header of the CURRENT workspace (see `data/api.ts`), so
 *    a catalog fetched under some other workspace's id would cache that
 *    workspace's key with this workspace's rows. Web passes an id because its
 *    inbox is cross-workspace; mobile's inbox is a single-workspace list, so
 *    reading the store is both simpler and the only correct option.
 * 2. **No `isPending` / `isError` / `retry`.** Web needs those because its
 *    board routes a status FILTER to server-side column branches and must hold
 *    its loading state rather than guess. Mobile filters client-side over an
 *    already-fetched list and groups on the concrete status key, so
 *    nothing here blocks on the catalog — a catalog that never arrives degrades
 *    to built-in labels or the raw custom key, without dropping any rows.
